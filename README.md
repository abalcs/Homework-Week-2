# Alan's Portfolio Project

For this project I have taken the lessons learned in the first 2 weeks of class to make a fully repsonsive portfolio website that showcases my key projects in a clean layout.

I have also created a personal logo for my nav bar and have used hover effects to add some color detail on the links that will direct the user to the corresponding page links.

## Tech Used

HTML, CSS, and a very small amount of Javascript.

### Issues

SVG's were used for the Github and Linkedin icons which created a slight contrast issue as flagged by Lighthouse.  

I could not resolve this so feel free to submit working solutions!
